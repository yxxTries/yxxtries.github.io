# Portfolio Stick Figure Timeline

This project is an interactive web-based portfolio that visualizes a career timeline using a growing stick figure and a vertical progress line. As you scroll, the stick figure "grows" and a bulge on the timeline displays different job experiences with styled descriptions.

## Features

- **Animated Stick Figure:** Scales up as you scroll down the page.
- **Vertical Timeline:** Shows career progression with a moving bulge and job descriptions.
- **Responsive Job Details:** Job title, location, and details update dynamically based on scroll position.
- **Modern CSS & JavaScript:** Uses CSS for layout and animation, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Scroll down to interact with the stick figure and view the timeline.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file.
- `style.css` – Styles for layout, stick figure, and timeline.
- `script.js` – Handles scroll events and dynamic content updates.

## Demo

> **Note:** The website is still under development. Features and design may change.
